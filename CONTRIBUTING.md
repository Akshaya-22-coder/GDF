## 🧭 Overview

GDF is a front-end project built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The repo includes several static pages and reusable component files like `_header.html` and `_footer.html`, located in the root and `assets/` directories.

This guide will walk you through **everything**:
- Forking, cloning, setting upstream
- Branching like a pro
- Making meaningful commits
- Writing clean, scalable front-end code
- Opening a pull request that makes maintainers go: _“Damn, that’s clean.”_
